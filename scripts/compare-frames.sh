# Frame-by-frame comparison of two builds of the runtime over many carts.
#
#   scripts/compare-frames.sh build OUT         build a deterministic scanner
#                                               of the working tree into OUT
#   scripts/compare-frames.sh diff OLD NEW CART...   compare two such scanners
#
# Typical use: build OUT=/tmp/old on the base commit (git stash or a
# checkout, then make deps), build OUT=/tmp/new with your change, then diff
# them over a folder of carts.  Each cart runs FRAMES (default 1500) frames
# of scripted input with seed 1; a cart is "same" when every frame's
# framebuffer hash matches.
#
# The scanner fixes Lua's string-hash seed; run under setarch -R so heap
# addresses repeat too.  Even so, a few carts (Kiloman, Grippy) iterate
# tables in address order and change their frames when only the binary's
# layout changes; check such DIFFs by padding static data or diffing the
# frame where they diverge before calling them regressions.
#
# diff exits 1 when any cart differs, and 2 when a scanner cannot run.  A
# cart that errors is compared like any other output: the same error at the
# same frame in both builds counts as "same".
