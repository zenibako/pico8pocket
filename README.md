# Pico8Pocket

PICO-8-compatible player for the Analogue Pocket, running on the
[openfpgaOS RISC-V environment](https://github.com/openfpgaOS/openfpgaSDK).

The compatibility target is PICO-8 **v0.2.7**. Both `.p8` and `.p8.png`
cartridges are in scope. The current alpha executes P8 Lua through z8lua,
decodes text and PNG carts, renders a 128×128 indexed framebuffer and packages
a native RV32 openFPGA core for Pocket.

Read [a personal note from the creator](ABOUT_ME.md) about how Pico8Pocket
started and how you can help improve it.

## Current state

- Host tests cover `.p8`, current and legacy compressed `.p8.png`, ZIP
  detection, integer scaling, P8 Lua execution and graphics/input calls.
  Celeste is the priority test cart: a locally supplied
  `assets/cards/celeste.p8.png` and/or `celeste_classic_2.p8.png` (never
  committed) adds an acceptance test to `make test` (600 frames of scripted
  play, then a mid-game save state that must replay the next 90 frames
  exactly), and `make celeste` compares frame output and host instructions
  per frame with the baseline recorded by `make celeste-baseline`.
- APF launches the core through a core-specific instance descriptor in slot 0;
  the Pocket file picker binds the selected cartridge to slot 4.
- `_init`, `_update`/`_update60` and `_draw` run at cartridge-selected 30 or
  60 FPS. Top-level and `_init` code also run cooperatively, so cartridges
  built around an infinite loop and `flip()` yield real frames instead of
  locking during load.
- Overloaded cartridges use adaptive render decimation: gameplay and input
  keep updating at full rate while `_draw` and video presentation fall back
  independently (60 FPS carts to 30, 20 or 15 FPS; 30 FPS carts to 15). This
  prevents effect-heavy scenes from slowing the entire game clock. A 30 FPS
  frame keeps every draw while its measured cost fits 32 ms of the 33.3 ms
  frame (15 ms at 60 FPS). The profiler's white number reports the resulting
  visible frame rate.
- The compatibility layer includes scaled `sspr`, texture-mapped `tline`,
  `oval`/`ovalfill`, patterned fills, 16/32-bit memory access, draw-state RAM
  aliases, remappable sprite/map memory and PICO-8's 32 KiB big-map mode.
- The audio backend implements `sfx()`/`music()`, four channels, the eight
  built-in waveforms, SFX loops, music patterns, fades and the standard
  slide/vibrato/drop/fade/arpeggio effects. Voices are synthesized at 24 kHz
  (PICO-8 itself runs at 22,050 Hz) and interpolated to the 48 kHz stereo
  output, entirely in integer/fixed point to leave the RISC-V CPU available
  for the Lua VM. Muting in the system menu skips synthesis altogether while
  music and effects keep their timing, so a CPU-heavy cart can be muted to
  gain a few milliseconds per frame.
- The current hardware-safe path scales 128×128 to 256×256 inside a proven
  320×288 openfpgaOS scanout. Pocket then scales the source 5×, producing a
  correct 1280×1280 image. Native 1408×1408 (11×) remains the target, but the
  stock bitstream's direct 128×128 mode crops the image on real hardware and
  is disabled until its scanout timing is fixed.
- Hardware testing showed that the experimental soft full-screen scaler was
  too blurry, so it has been removed. `2X` remains the default crisp,
  pixel-perfect path while native 11× output is investigated separately.
- Drawing uses an unpacked one-byte-per-pixel working surface and lazily
  synchronizes PICO-8's packed screen RAM for memory APIs. This removes the
  packed read-modify-write from the common sprite/pixel path and maps the
  display palette during the existing 2× presentation pass.
- Default controls are `B = O`, `A = X`, `Start = Pause`; `Y` and `X` are
  alternate `O` and `X` buttons. The in-core menu has a global profile plus a
  content-hash-keyed override for each cartridge; D-pad, A/B/X/Y, L/R and Start
  can all be reassigned while Select remains reserved for the system UI.
- Pressing Select opens the PICO-8-styled system menu and fully pauses the
  cartridge with a short audio fade. Holding Select and pressing the physical X
  button, or pressing X from the main system menu, toggles the opt-in
  profiler. Its labelled rows show logical FPS (`L`), visible FPS (`V`), update
  time (`U`), draw time (`D`), audio time (`A`), presentation time (`P`), the
  active render divisor (`R`), a Lua activity count (`K`) and the full runtime
  step the frame-skip scheduler measures (`F`: update and draw plus audio
  serviced mid-frame, garbage collection and frame setup). A second column counts sprite/map work (`S`), primitive
  graphics calls (`G`), memory/map/flag access (`M`), draw-state changes (`C`),
  text calls (`T`), input reads (`B`) and helpers such as `rnd`, `all` and
  `foreach` (`Q`). The profiler is hidden on every fresh launch.
- The paused cartridge behind the system menu is rendered through a dedicated
  15%-brightness palette before the checkerboard shade is applied, while menu
  text and panels retain their full palette brightness.
- Controller state is sampled from a lightweight Lua instruction hook while a
  cartridge frame is running. Short gameplay presses and system-button edges
  are retained until the main loop consumes them, including when emulation is
  below its target frame rate. Raw P8SCII and UTF-8 button-glyph constants are
  registered as the six standard buttons, matching compact PNG carts that use
  `btn(⬅️)`, `btn(🅾️)` or `btn(❎)` instead of numeric button indices.
- `.p8` text carts have their UTF-8 glyphs converted back to P8SCII bytes on
  load, and `print()` implements PICO-8's text engine: the full default font,
  custom fonts and P8SCII control codes, including memory pokes. Drawing can
  be redirected to the sprite sheet through `0x5f55`.
- Nested PICO-8 shorthand statements now share their terminating source
  newline correctly. This fixes minified cartridges such as Moss Moss where a
  nested one-line `if` previously swallowed the following movement code into
  the wrong branch.
- The interpreter is tuned for the Pocket's 100 MHz RV32 CPU (no
  double-precision FPU, 8 KB instruction cache, 14 KB of zero-wait BRAM that
  holds the dispatch loop). z8lua is patched (`patches/`) to keep the program
  counter in a register, check its service hook only at jumps and calls,
  cache the hash slot of every constant-name table access, compare numbers,
  strings and nil inline, follow `__index` chains for `_ENV` objects, call
  PICO-8 API functions through a short path and format numbers in fixed
  point. `time()`, `all()` and fill patterns avoid software doubles,
  per-element API calls and per-pixel work. Scaled sprites and ellipses avoid
  per-pixel division/64-bit implicit-equation work.
- The menu provides Quick Save, nine numbered state slots, 64×64 previews,
  guarded deletion, restart, cart switching, controls, pixel-perfect scale,
  volume/mute, cartridge info and English or Russian UI. States serialize Lua
  closures/globals through Eris together with RAM, framebuffer, palettes, RNG,
  input and audio channel position.
- State files are compressed and keyed by cartridge content rather than path.
  Each of Pocket's ten 256 KiB nonvolatile slots stores the corresponding
  logical state for several cartridges and evicts the least-recently-saved
  record only when that particular physical slot fills.
- `cartdata`, `dget` and `dset` use the same nonvolatile packed store and are
  keyed by the cartridge-supplied data ID. Dirty data is flushed periodically,
  on state saves and whenever the system menu opens.
- `Select Cart` directs the user to AnalogueOS Core Settings → Cartridge. The
  cartridge data slot is user-reloadable and restart-on-load. Its filename is
  deliberately not persisted, so every fresh core launch opens Pocket's native
  cartridge picker instead of reopening the previously used cart.
- Public releases contain no cartridges or third-party sound banks. The
  `Assets/pico8/common/cards/` directory contains only installation
  instructions; users provide cartridges they are entitled to use.
- `make package` produces the public, cartridge-free Pocket ZIP containing the
  pinned `os20` bitstream and statically linked `rv32imafc` application.
  `make package-local` is an explicit private-build target which additionally
  bundles carts found under `assets/cards/`, `Доп игры` and `Топ игры`.
- Runtime failures show their actual Lua error on screen instead of the old
  rainbow bring-up square. Select remains available on that screen, allowing
  the cartridge to be restarted or exited without restarting the core.

- Cartridge `menuitem()` entries appear in the Select system menu right after
  RESUME, with their callbacks, left/right input and button filters.

This is still an alpha, not a full-compatibility release. Local multicart
switching, ZIP extraction and the indexed in-core browser are not implemented
yet. Save-state persistence, menu/input behavior, profiling and the current 2X
presentation path have been validated on physical Pocket hardware. CPU-heavy
cartridges and scaler behavior beyond the established 2X path still need more
compatibility and performance work.

## Build

Run the portable tests:

```sh
make test
```

Fetch the pinned upstream dependencies:

```sh
make deps
```

Build and assemble the Pocket SD tree:

```sh
make pocket
```

The result is written to `build/pocket/pico8pocket/`. `make package` creates a
public, cartridge-free release ZIP under `releases/`. With a local Homebrew
RISC-V toolchain, use:

```sh
make package USE_SDK_CONTAINER=0
```

For private hardware testing with locally supplied cartridges, use:

```sh
make package-local USE_SDK_CONTAINER=0
```

The local archive is named `pico8pocket-v<VERSION>-local.zip` so it cannot be
mistaken for the public artifact. Local cartridge directories are ignored by
Git.

To compare two builds on hardware, repackage one as a separate core that
installs beside the other and shares its cards:

```sh
scripts/variant-core.sh releases/pico8pocket-v<VERSION>.zip b "Test build B" b.zip
```

It becomes `zenibako.pico8b`; its program, configuration, settings and save
files get their own names, so neither core's files replace the other's.

The platform banner `dist/platforms/_images/pico8.bin` is generated from
`assets/branding/pico8-platform.png`; after changing the PNG, regenerate it
with:

```sh
scripts/platform-image.py assets/branding/pico8-platform.png dist/platforms/_images/pico8.bin
```

The RISC-V build uses the same container toolchain as openfpgaOS. Docker,
OrbStack, or Apple's `container` runtime is required unless a compatible
`riscv64-elf`/`riscv64-unknown-elf` toolchain is installed locally.

Install by extracting the release ZIP at the root of the Pocket SD card,
merging its `Cores`, `Assets` and `Platforms` folders with the existing ones.
The core is `zenibako.pico8` on the `pico8` platform (shown as PICO-8):

```text
/Cores/zenibako.pico8/
/Assets/pico8/common/              application, OS and cards/
/Assets/pico8/zenibako.pico8/      launch entry
/Platforms/pico8.json
/Platforms/_images/pico8.bin       PICO-8 banner in the platform list
```

On launch, Pocket's native asset picker asks for a `.p8` or `.p8.png`
cartridge.

Upgrading from a release that installed `Askent.pico8pocket`: move your carts
from `/Assets/pico8pocket/common/cards/` to `/Assets/pico8/common/cards/`, then
delete `/Cores/Askent.pico8pocket`, `/Assets/pico8pocket` and
`/Platforms/pico8pocket.json`. Save states, settings and cartdata are kept per
platform under `/Saves`: to keep them, move the contents of
`/Saves/pico8pocket/` to `/Saves/pico8/` before starting the new core.

## Cartridge location

Install cartridges under:

```text
/Assets/pico8/common/cards/
```

Analogue's APF inserts `common` for platform assets, so this is the canonical
Pocket path corresponding to the requested `/assets/pico8/cards` area.
At launch, Pocket's native asset picker selects the primary cart. The
planned in-core browser will consume an index stored beside the cards; see
[architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the APF filesystem constraint.

## Upstream bases

- Diablo/openfpgaOS SDK and Pocket runtime commit
  `8cb3198d50618696e07f5b49ad086a369dc57706` (API 0.9.0, the runtime
  shipped with Diablo 1.1.0)
- openfpgaOS SDK commit `628a12b551ac8137373c477e97466b84d153d2af`

- Fake-08 commit `814991a2571ad3970e386cef48f3b148aa1c27b9`, with z8lua at
  its submodule pin `e6928578` plus local patches (including backports of
  newer upstream z8lua fixes)
- PICO-8 behavior target: [official v0.2.7 manual](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html)

These revisions are pinned by `scripts/fetch-deps.sh` so builds do not silently
change when upstream moves. Diablo is fetched as a shallow, sparse Git checkout
of the pinned commit (only `runtime/pocket`, `src/sdk` and `tools`), and the
three Pocket runtime files are additionally verified by SHA-256.
